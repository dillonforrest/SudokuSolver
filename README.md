Sudoku solver written in python.  Hoping to practice some recursion.  So far, it's still been mostly object-orientated programming.

To run the script, type in the terminal "python <filename>.py row1 row2 ... row9", where row1 is a nine-digit number representing the first row of given numbers.  Blanks should be zeroes.  Row2 is the second row, and so on until row9.
